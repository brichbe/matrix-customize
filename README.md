# matrix-customize

A simple project that combines elements of [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) together with a javascript algorithm that produces an effect  similar to the well-known [Matrix Raining Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqUR3KtWbTk).  The UI allows the user to customize the behavior of the effect, such as choosing the characters and colors being displayed.
